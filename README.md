## How AI Was Used

Artificial Intelligence was instrumental in shaping this project. Here are some key ways AI contributed to its development:

- **Code Generation**

AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot, were utilized to generate code snippets for different sections of the website, including its HTML structure and CSS styling. The AI offered context-aware suggestions, helping to streamline development and accelerate the coding process.

- **Debugging**

AI-powered debugging tools were employed to detect and resolve coding issues. By analyzing the codebase, these tools identified potential bugs and provided recommendations for fixes, ensuring a smoother development process and a more reliable final product.

- **Image Generation**

DALL-E, an AI model developed by OpenAI, was used to generate the images for the website.

- **Content Assistance**

AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot, played a key role in both coding and content creation for the website. By offering smart suggestions and auto-completions, these tools helped streamline development, improve efficiency, and maintain high-quality code.

- **Accessibility Improvements**

AI tools, such as Lighthouse, were utilized to evaluate the website’s accessibility features. These tools assessed how well the site accommodates users with disabilities and provided recommendations to enhance user experience, ensuring a more inclusive and user-friendly design.

By integrating AI, the project successfully enhanced efficiency, fostered creativity, and improved accessibility, resulting in a more streamlined and inclusive development process.

## Features

The website includes several features, which are detailed below.

### Existing Features

- **Colour Palette**

The website incorporates shades of pink, a color often associated with compassion, warmth, and inclusivity. Pink evokes a sense of openness and connection, reinforcing the website’s commitment to fostering diversity and belonging. To ensure readability and a clean design, pink is complemented by neutral tones, creating a balanced and visually engaging experience. The color palette is consistently applied across all website elements, including backgrounds, text, buttons, and links, maintaining a cohesive and welcoming aesthetic.
